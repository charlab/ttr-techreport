Caches are integral to the performance of the memory
subsystem for any processor.
In contemporary literature, it is common to use metrics such as a
count of memory misses over some number of instructions, or to use the
rate of instruction issue as a proxy for true system performance as
indicators of the performance of a last level cache.
We introduce a novel metric called ``Time to Recache'' (TTR) that more
directly represents the closeness with which any technique approaches
the optimal caching scheme.
As an example of how this metric might be used, we include an analysis
of a few traditional and modern replacement policies using
cycle-accurate processor and cache simulation.
